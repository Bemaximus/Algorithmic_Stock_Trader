## Algorithmic_Stock_Trader
This is an algorithmic stock trading program that uses big events for companies and makes predictive trades depending on the nature of the event. There is a preset algorithm that I implemented, but any algorithm can be created and imported into this program.

## Some Useful Features
- Integrated TD Ameritrade API to communicate directly with your bank account.
- Automated TD Ameritrade API token generator included.
- Integrated web scraper for stock data collection (currently tailored to dividend data).
- Integrated Telegram API for a text-based interface and to recieve transaction updates and control the program.
- Integrated portfolio tracker to track, in detail, how your portfolio is doing.
